burning tires tear gas and clashes with riot police the ugly scenes that come with workers strikes are all too familiar in france a country constantly trying to balance its culture of workers rights with a more efficient economy
such scenes are being played out across the country friday as unions have called for workers to step up protests that have for the past week crippled parts of france
employees of oil refineries nuclear power plants and some public transportation have left one in three gas stations dry forcing vehicles to search for well stocked stations and causing long lines at the pump
people are now hoarding gas worried that it may be some time until supply levels are back to normal
the workers are protesting a labor reform bill put forward by the government that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire employees
the governments argument is that the strict laws that make french workers among the best protected in the world leave companies in a difficult position where they cant take on new staff
french prime minister manuel valls told local media on thursday that he might be willing to modify some of the proposals giving hope to french people that the protests and fuel shortages may soon stop
but workers unions friday responded with a call to step up rallies and blockades demanding a complete withdrawal of the bill
we call for the continuation and intensification of protests a group of unions behind the protests said in a statement
the governments violent words its contempt for the social movement and its refusal to withdraw this bill reinforces our commitment it said
